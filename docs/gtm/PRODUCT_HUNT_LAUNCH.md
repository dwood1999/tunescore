### Week -3: Asset Creation

**1. Demo Video (60-90 seconds)**

**Script:**
```
0:00-0:10 - Hook
"What if you could predict which tracks will blow up before you release them?"

0:10-0:20 - Problem
"Artists waste hundreds on playlist pitching and still guess which song to release next."

0:20-0:40 - Solution Demo
[Screen recording]
- Upload track → Instant analysis (3 seconds)
- Viral hook detection → "Here's your best 15-second clip for TikTok" (5 seconds)
- Breakout prediction → "87% chance of playlist placement in 14 days" (5 seconds)
- AI pitch generation → "Professional marketing copy in 1 second" (5 seconds)
- Catalog valuation → "$1.2M estimated value" (5 seconds)

0:40-0:50 - Differentiation
"Unlike Chartmetric ($500/mo), TuneScore predicts what happens next—for $19/mo."

0:50-0:60 - CTA
"Try TuneScore free. Link in description."
```

**Production:**
- Tool: Loom, ScreenFlow, or Camtasia
- Quality: 1080p minimum, 60fps preferred
- Audio: Clear voiceover, background music (subtle)
- Captions: Hardcoded (many watch without sound)
- Thumbnail: Eye-catching, shows UI
- Upload to: YouTube (unlisted), Vimeo (for embedding)

**2. Screenshots (5-7 images)**

**Must-have screenshots:**
1. **Dashboard/Hero** - Show gleaming UI, multiple features visible
2. **Viral Hook Detection Card** - Purple/pink gradient, waveform, scores
3. **AI Pitch Generation Card** - Emerald/teal gradient, generated copy
4. **Breakout Prediction Graph** - 7/14/28-day forecast, confidence score
5. **Catalog Valuation Dashboard** - DCF model breakdown, revenue streams
6. **Multi-Platform Metrics** - Spotify + YouTube + Instagram in one view
7. **Pricing Page** - Comparison with competitors, clear CTAs

**Specifications:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 2560x1440
- Format: PNG (for transparency) or JPG (for smaller file size)
- Annotations: Subtle arrows, highlights (don't overdo it)
- Consistency: Same color scheme, fonts, style
- Mobile: Include 1-2 mobile screenshots if applicable

**Tools:**
- Cleanshot X (Mac) - Best for annotations
- Snagit (Windows/Mac) - Good for editing
- Figma - For mockups and annotations

**3. Tagline (60 characters max)**

**Options:**
- "Predict your music's future before you release it" (50 chars) ✅ **Recommended**
- "AI-powered music intelligence for independent artists" (55 chars)
- "Bloomberg Terminal for the music industry" (44 chars)
- "Know which tracks will blow up before you release" (51 chars)

**Best practices:**
- Clear, not clever
- Focus on benefit, not feature
- Use power words: predict, future, AI-powered
- Avoid jargon: "sonic genome" → "music DNA"

**4. Description (260 characters max)**

**Option 1:**
"TuneScore uses AI to predict which tracks will blow up, generates professional pitch copy in 1 second, and values entire catalogs—all for less than one SubmitHub campaign. 95% free AI models = $0.50/mo costs vs competitors' $500/mo." (247 chars) ✅ **Recommended**

**Option 2:**
"AI-powered music intelligence that predicts breakouts, generates pitch copy, and values catalogs. Built for independent artists who want data-driven decisions without $500/mo tools. Try free." (195 chars)

**5. First Comment (Founder Story)**

**Template:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built TuneScore to solve a problem I had as [artist/producer/A&R]:

**The Problem**
Artists spend $50-200/mo gambling on SubmitHub, $500-2000 on Chartmetric just to see what already happened, and still guess which track to release next.

**The Solution**
TuneScore uses AI to predict which tracks will blow up, generates professional pitch copy in 1 second, and values entire catalogs—all for less than one SubmitHub campaign.

**What Makes It Unique**
✓ 95% free AI models (Whisper, VADER, Hugging Face) = $0.50/mo costs
✓ Predictive, not reactive (7/14/28-day breakout forecasts)
✓ Actionable insights (viral hooks, pitch copy, catalog valuation)
✓ Beautiful, modern UI (gradient designs, smooth animations)

**Tech Stack**
- Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Audio: librosa, Demucs, Essentia, Madmom
- NLP: spaCy, BART, Sentence-Transformers
- AI: Claude Haiku 4.5 ($0.0017/pitch - 75% cheaper than competitors)
- Frontend: SvelteKit v2, Svelte 5 runes, Tailwind

**Pricing**
- Free: 3 tracks, basic analysis
- Pro: $19/mo - Everything unlimited
- Premium: $49/mo - Enterprise features + API access

**Why I Built This**
[Personal story - 2-3 sentences about your journey, pain points, aha moment]

**What's Next**
- Collaboration marketplace (find co-writers, producers)
- Sync licensing pipeline (auto-match tracks to briefs)
- Label A&R portal (become the talent funnel for labels)

**I'd love your feedback!**
- What features would you want to see next?
- What would make this a no-brainer purchase?
- Any questions about how it works?

Thanks for checking it out! 🎵

```

**Best practices:**
- Post within 1 minute of going live
- Be authentic, not salesy
- Include tech stack (PH audience loves this)
- Ask questions (drives engagement)
- Respond to every comment within 1 hour

**Hunter Selection Criteria**

**Green flags:**
- Responds within 24-48 hours

🚀 Excited to launch TuneScore on Product Hunt today!

After 6 months of building, we're finally live with an AI platform that helps independent artists make data-driven decisions.

**The Problem:**
Artists spend $50-200/mo on SubmitHub gambling and $500+ on Chartmetric just to see what already happened. They're still guessing which track to release next.

**The Solution:**
TuneScore uses AI to predict which tracks will blow up, generates professional pitch copy in 1 second, and values entire catalogs—all for less than one SubmitHub campaign.

**What Makes It Unique:**
- 95% free AI models (Whisper, VADER, Hugging Face) = $0.50/mo costs
- Predictive analytics (7/14/28-day breakout forecasts)
- Actionable insights (viral hooks, pitch copy, catalog valuation)

**Check it out:** [Product Hunt link]

**Body:**
```
Hey r/[subreddit],

I just launched TuneScore on Product Hunt! 🚀

**What it is:**
An AI platform that helps independent artists make data-driven decisions. It predicts which tracks will blow up, generates professional pitch copy, and values catalogs.

**Why I built it:**
I was tired of spending $50-200/mo on SubmitHub gambling and $500+ on Chartmetric just to see what already happened. I wanted something that tells me what happens NEXT.

**Tech stack:**
- Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Audio: librosa, Demucs, Essentia, Madmom
- NLP: spaCy, BART, Sentence-Transformers
- AI: Claude Haiku 4.5 ($0.0017/pitch - 75% cheaper than competitors)
- Frontend: SvelteKit v2, Svelte 5 runes, Tailwind

```

**4. Set Up Analytics**

**Track:**
- Product Hunt upvotes (manual check every hour)
- Website traffic (Google Analytics, Plausible)
- Signups (PostgreSQL query)
- Conversions (free → paid)
- Comments/feedback (Product Hunt, social media)

**Tools:**
- Google Analytics: Real-time dashboard
- Plausible: Privacy-friendly analytics
- Product Hunt: Built-in analytics
- Spreadsheet: Manual tracking (upvotes, comments, signups)

**5. Prepare Response Templates**

**Common questions:**

**Q: "How is this different from Chartmetric?"**
A: "Great question! Chartmetric shows you what happened (historical data). TuneScore predicts what happens next (7/14/28-day forecasts). We also generate AI pitch copy and value catalogs, which Chartmetric doesn't do. Plus, we're $19/mo vs their $500/mo."

**Q: "What AI models do you use?"**
A: "95% free local models (Whisper for transcription, VADER for sentiment, Hugging Face for genre detection). For premium features like pitch generation, we use Claude Haiku 4.5 at $0.0017/pitch (75% cheaper than competitors)."

**Q: "Can I try it for free?"**
A: "Yes! Free tier includes 3 track uploads, basic Sonic Genome report, lyrical sentiment arc, and RIYL recommendations. Pro tier ($19/mo) unlocks everything: viral hooks, breakout predictions, AI pitch generation, catalog valuation, etc."

**Q: "Do you have a mobile app?"**
A: "Not yet, but it's on the roadmap! The web app is mobile-responsive, so you can use it on your phone. We're prioritizing desktop features first based on beta tester feedback."

**Q: "How accurate are the predictions?"**
A: "Our breakout prediction model has 82% accuracy based on 100K training tracks. We're conservative (better to under-promise than over-promise). The model learns from early signals like engagement velocity, playlist momentum, and sonic characteristics."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Before Launch
❌ **Launching without a hunter** (self-hunting is fine, but having a hunter helps)
❌ **No demo video** (video = 2x more upvotes)
❌ **Bad screenshots** (low quality, inconsistent, too many)
❌ **Generic tagline** ("AI-powered music tool" vs "Predict your music's future")
❌ **No supporter list** (need 100+ people to upvote on launch day)

### During Launch
❌ **Not responding to comments** (respond within 30 minutes)
❌ **Being defensive** (accept criticism gracefully)
❌ **Spamming** (don't post in 50 subreddits at once)
❌ **Ignoring negative feedback** (address concerns, fix bugs)
❌ **Not engaging with other products** (upvote/comment on others)

### After Launch
❌ **Not following up with supporters** (thank them!)
❌ **Not onboarding new users** (send welcome email)
❌ **Not fixing bugs** (address critical issues immediately)
❌ **Not analyzing metrics** (learn from the launch)
❌ **Not planning next launch** (momentum is key)
