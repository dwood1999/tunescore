**Title:**
"Built an AI tool that predicts which tracks will blow up—looking for 10 beta testers"

**Body:**
```
Hey r/[subreddit],

I've spent the last 6 months building TuneScore—an AI platform that analyzes your tracks and predicts commercial success BEFORE you release.

**What it does:**
✓ Finds your best 15-second clips for TikTok/Reels (viral hook detection)
✓ Predicts breakout potential (7/14/28-day forecasts)
✓ Generates professional pitch copy in 1 second ($0.0017 vs competitors' $5-10)
✓ Deep audio analysis (stem separation, harmonic mathematics, healing frequencies)
✓ Multi-platform tracking (Spotify + YouTube + Instagram)

**Why I built it:**
I was tired of spending $50-200/month on SubmitHub gambling and $500+ on Chartmetric just to see what already happened. I wanted something that tells me what happens NEXT.

**What I'm looking for:**
10 beta testers to try it for FREE (lifetime Pro access worth $228/year).

**Requirements:**
- Have 3+ released tracks on Spotify/YouTube
- Willing to give honest feedback (15-min call after testing)
- Active on social media (optional but appreciated)

**What you get:**
- Lifetime Pro access (normally $19/mo)
- Early influence on product direction
- Your music featured in our launch case studies (if you want)

Comment or DM if interested. First 10 get in.

Demo: [link to waitlist page with demo video]
```

**Best time to post:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM EST (highest engagement)
- Avoid weekends (lower engagement)
